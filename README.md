# MathMind
## Behind MathMind:
While learining HTML, CSS and JS, I've decided to create a web page to put into practice what I've learnt.
This page and it's content might change in the future, it depends on what I feel to create.
I don't have a lot free time so I don't know when this page will get updates, I hope to update it relatively often.

## MathMind Project:
This is a game created to improve your speed and precision at mental calculations and keep your mind trained

You can choose between various difficulty levels and differnt types of operations, from sums to square roots (and maybe even beyond that)!!

For every operation that you got right your score will increase so you can challenge yourself to get better and better every day!
